    "There are two important methods in Pexpect – `expect()` and `send()` (or `sendline()` which is like `send()` with a linefeed). The `expect()` method waits for the child application to return a given string. The string you specify is a regular expression, so you can match complicated patterns. The `send()` method writes a string to the child application. From the child’s point of view it looks just like someone typed the text from a terminal. After each call to `expect()` the before and after properties will be set to the text printed by child application. The before property will contain all text up to the expected string pattern. The after string will contain the text that was matched by the expected pattern. We can also fetch all the information before we reached a pattern as well with `before`."
