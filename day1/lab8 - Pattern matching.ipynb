    "You may be familiar with searching for text by pressing CTRL-F and typing in the words you’re looking for. Regular expressions go one step further: They allow you to specify a pattern of text to search for. You may not know a business’s exact email address, but you will know it will be one or more names, maybe some special characters between the name, followed by a at-symbol, and then a domain-name followed by a top-level domain (.com, .se). This is how you, as a human, know a email when you see it: dennis.hedlund@klarna.com is a email address, but dennis,hedlund!@klarna.not.valid is not.\n",

Regular expressions are huge time-savers, not just for software users but also for programmers. In fact, tech writer Cory Doctorow argues that even before teaching programming, we should be teaching regular expressions:\n",
